# Learn Co Cheat Sheet

At this point, you've gone through the intro to Nitrous track, and are getting used working in the command line. It's a lot! Here is a 'cheat sheet' that you can refer to with important commands to use in your Nitrous command line:

## Basic Shell Commands

+ `pwd`: Print Working Directory. Where you currently are.
+ `ls`: List the files and directories are within the directory where you are standing by using
+ `cd`: change directories by using the cd <directory-name> command.
  + `cd ..`: to move up one directory.
  + `cd ../..`: will bring you up two parent directories
+ `mkdir <directory-name>`: makes a new directory.
+ `touch <file-name.extension>`: create a file
+ `rm <file-name>`: Remove a file
+ `rm -rf <file-name>`: Remove a directory and everything inside it.
+ `mv <file to move> <final destination>`: to move a file to a new destination. You have to be in the same directory as the file you are moving.


## Learn Commands

+ `learn open`: Opens your current lesson. The same as clicking the "Open in Nitrous" button on Learn.co.
+ `learn`: Run the test file to check your code.
+ `learn submit`: Submit your code to Learn.co (opens a Pull Request agaisnt the main lab repository)

Note: You've read about git commands to fork, clone, add, commit, push, etc. You'll learn a lot more about these down the line, but for now focus on learning to code and use the `learn` commands above to interact with the curriculum.
